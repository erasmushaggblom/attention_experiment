Academic performance report, #*Principal &*Performance at # has been satisfactory this year. The results from our tests showed average test scores of 73% among our students. The results were similar between subjects, but the average score conceals some considerable variation among students.*For all subjects tested at #, a large group of students scored very well while another group scored poorly. The middle group is smaller. The highest percentage of students scoring well was in math at 42%, but 29% also scored poorly. In science, 38% scored well, while 24% scored poorly. In reading, the gap was smaller but still present, with 29% of students performing well and 27% performing poorly.*There are some concerns among staff at # that we are insufficiently addressing inequality among students at our school.
