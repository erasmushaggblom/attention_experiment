Academic performance report, #*Principal &*Some of our older students have studied at # for a few years now. I am happy to report that they are satisfied with the school and have shown progress in their grades compared to four years ago. We are confident that they will do well in future studies.*The students also stated that when they first transferred to #, they were warned about the weaker performance of students there. However, the concern was unwarranted because most students have done well over the last few years. The students also cited the improved atmosphere of the school and found teachers approachable for advice and support.*We believe that the experiences of these students reflect the positive direction we have taken at # over the last several years.
