Academic performance report, #*Principal &*At #, we have been pleased with our students' results. Students achieved an average learning result of 65%. For every subject, the average results exceeded an acceptable threshold of 60%. However, the average score conceals variation within the subjects.*The highest percentage of very strong results was in science, where 26% of students scored above 80%. Yet, 22% of the students did very poorly. Most of the poor results were in math, with 32% of all students scoring below 50%. Yet, 21% did very well. The highest percentage of students with moderate, though not excellent, scores was in reading, at 39%.*Given the variation between subjects, our plan at # is to encourage teachers to share experiences and best practices to promote consistency in learning outcomes.
