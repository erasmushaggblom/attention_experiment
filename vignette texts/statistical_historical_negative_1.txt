Academic performance report, #*Principal &*I regret to report that learning outcomes have continued to decline at #. The yearly average test scores of 54% were the lowest since testing began in 2014. Learning outcomes at # have steadily declined over the past several years because of problems with staff turnover.*Results have been especially poor in reading, with a decline from the top results of 77% in 2017 to 42% in 2024. Results in science have declined every year since 2015, with results of 48% in 2024. Problems in math have been less significant, but the average results of 70% were also lower than 2020, when students had average scores of 82%.*Considering the challenges # is currently experiencing, we have designed an action plan to improve scores next year.
