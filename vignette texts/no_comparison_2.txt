Academic performance report, #*Principal &*I have been informed by the parents of some of our students at # that their children experienced social difficulties during school hours. There appears to be a conflict between two groups of children in second grade. So far, there are no indications that any bullying has occurred.*However, we have concerns that this conflict may spill over to other grades and affect the broader learning environment at #. Therefore, we plan to have teachers mediate between both groups of students. The hope is that this action will encourage the students to find common ground with one another rather than seek further conflict.*Unfortunately, teachers at # have limited time to perform this mediation. For now, the school's leadership will monitor the situation to assess progress.
