Academic performance report, #*Principal &*# has achieved notable learning results this year compared to other schools in the region. Overall, the student test results were 73%, surpassing the average of 61% in the other four regional schools.*Unsurprisingly, # was the top-ranked school in the area by a clear margin. The primary reason for the overall high performance at # was an exceptionally strong result in science, with an average score of 86% among participating students. The results for reading, at 73%, and math, at 70%, were also impressive compared to the region, but the differences were much smaller.*We plan to hold discussions with our language and math teachers at # on how the competitive advantages we have established for science might be utilised in language and math teaching.
