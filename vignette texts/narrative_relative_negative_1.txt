Academic performance report, #*Principal &*I have learned that some students who came to # from a nearby school have had a worse experience compared to their former school. They have found our teachers to be rigid. Teachers at their previous school were always actively checking how the students were doing.*This so-called rigidity reflects our educational approach at # in which students have to raise their voice if they have a problem. The new students have found this difficult and their grades have started to decline. They also mentioned that they have received less extra teaching in our school in areas where they struggle.*One teacher has tried to address this issue. One concern is the policy at # to authorise overtime only when clearly necessary. We will consider adjustments.
