Academic performance report, #*Principal &*I would like to discuss the experiences of several students at #. These students have had average results so far, but are now facing new learning issues. They have struggled to maintain consistent performance. They generally perform well on one test and poorly on another.*To assist these students in particular, we have redirected some of our special education resources at #, such as audiobooks and text-to-speech software, to them. We believe these students have potential and could excel with a bit more support. One challenge is that we do not want to restrict other students' access to these learning resources.*Staff at # monitor the situation to determine if our new approach will improve outcomes. They also assess whether the approach has any adverse effects.
