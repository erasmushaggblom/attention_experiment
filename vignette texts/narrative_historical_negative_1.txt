Academic performance report, #*Principal &*We have received word from some students who stated that they have not enjoyed their time at # over the last several years. The students said they have been unhappy with their teachers and that the teachers did not provide enough support when the students had poor grades.*The students have had issues with their test results while at #. A few years ago, they were able to read above their age level; however, they have fallen behind. They have had particular issues in science and have experienced a steady decline in test scores in the subject.*Though these issues are longstanding, we were only recently made aware of them. Staff from # intend to meet with the parents of these students to discuss further actions.
