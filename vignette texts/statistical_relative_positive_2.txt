Academic performance report, #*Principal &*I am pleased to announce that we have been exceptionally successful in achieving our learning outcome goals at # this year, particularly compared to the other schools in our area. Our overall student test results were 75%, ranking first among the four local schools.*A crucial aspect of the results at # was consistency, showcasing strong performance across learning outcomes. Results for math at 72%, reading at 78%, and science at 75% were each commendable. Each of these results was the best in the region.*There have been requests from parents at other schools to transfer to # for the next academic year. Although we are currently at capacity, we would certainly be able to accept additional students if given the chance to hire more staff.
