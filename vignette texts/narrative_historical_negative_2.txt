Academic performance report, #*Principal &*I need to inform you that parents of some students at # have reported that their children have had trouble at # over the last five years. The parents feel that the school has not matched the ambition of the students.*The students wish to study medicine, and the parents have expressed concern. The students have always been strong in science, but have faced issues with math. Two years ago, the students were able to improve their results, but these improvements did not persist.*The parents have stated that a teacher at # suggested they should not complain about the results. We are concerned about how the parents said their children have been treated here and intend to discuss this further among our teachers and staff.
