Academic performance report, #*Principal &*The parents of some former students at # have contacted us to return to our school. They stated that they have come to recognise the quality of our teaching. They say that their children were much happier at our school.*Teachers at # place great emphasis on helping students identify the areas in which they excel. At their current school, the students have been unable to explore the subjects they enjoy in their learning. As a result, the students have had difficulties maintaining focus in class. Our special education teachers can assist with attention issues.*The students have not received similar support at their current school. This is the reason why parents are unhappy. We are very proud of the good reputation of teaching at #.
